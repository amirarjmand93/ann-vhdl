Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 8.949 is 3.083(34.5%) logic and 5.866(65.5%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

===============================================================================================
Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 8.879 is 3.013(33.9%) logic and 5.866(66.1%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value
